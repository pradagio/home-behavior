Demi is a practicing Buddhist who has a collected the Buddha's stories for decades. For this collection, Buddha Stories, she selected ten of her favorites from 550 known tales. While illustrating the stories, she was inspired by some of the oldest Buddhist texts, which were printed in gold ink on indigo paper. "Because this conception is so exquisitely beautiful and corresponds with the Buddhist tradition, I decided to use it in Buddha Stories," says Demi.
